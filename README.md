# 18_Social-Network-API
NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description

In this instance I was tasked with developing an API for a social network that supports the following functions: creating, updating, and deleting users; creating and deleting thoughts and reactions; and adding and deleting friends. This API does not include a front-end interface; all routes have been tested using Postman and Insomnia.
